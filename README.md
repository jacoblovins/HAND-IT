## Description

This gesture recognition component lets you easily add hand gesture functionality to your React.js application. Using the power of Tensorflow.js and ML5, this component will recognize your hand gestures and allow you to assign actions to them.

## Installation

To install, run the following command:

``` npm i hand-it```

Import HandGest and the optional poseParameters into the component you would like to use it in:

``` import {HandGest, poseParameters} from 'hand-it'```

Now download the model data [HERE](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/jacoblovins/HAND-IT/tree/master/data). Unzip and place the data folder with it's contents inside your public folder in your React.js application.

You can now use the ```<HandGest />``` component.

## Custom Hand Gestures

The current pre-trained hand gestures that come with HAND-IT are:
1. Point Up
2. Point Down
3. OK
4. Fist

If you want to use your own custom hand gestures, our [TRAIN-IT](https://jacoblovins.github.io/TRAIN-IT/) site makes it easy.

Just follow the directions, download the files and drop them into your data directory. Add your custom gesture names to the pose parameters and you're ready to go!

## Optional parameters:

If you are using custom gestures from [TRAIN-IT](https://jacoblovins.github.io/TRAIN-IT/)
``` 
poseParameters.pose1 = "<your custom gesture name>";
poseParameters.pose2 = "<your custom gesture name> ";
poseParameters.pose3 = "<your custom gesture name> ";
poseParameters.pose4 = "<your custom gesture name>";
```
NOTE: Make sure ```"<your custom gesture name>"``` matches exactly what you entered when training the model or your actions will not work.

Change the rate at which HAND-IT classifies your hand gestures in milliseconds:
```
poseParameters.classifySpeed: 300,
```

Change the video displays width and height:
```
poseParameters.webcamWidth: 640,
poseParameters.webcamHeight: 480,
```

Add any action to trigger when HAND-IT recognizes your gesture:
```
poseParameters.pose1Action = () => {
    <!-- gesture 1 action code here -->
    console.log("Point UP is Working!")
}

poseParameters.pose2Action = () => {
    <!-- gesture 2 action code here -->
  console.log("Point Down is Working!")
}

poseParameters.pose3Action = () => {
    <!-- gesture 3 action code here -->
  console.log("Point Left is Working!")
}

poseParameters.pose4Action = () => {
    <!-- gesture 4 action code here -->
  console.log("Point Right is Working!")
} 
```
